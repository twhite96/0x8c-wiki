# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Welcome to 0x8C Wiki

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of my main work will be on [my blog ](https://0x8c.org\))and my [cyber notes site](https://notes.0xda.org) This site will be a living document of things I have either worked on and discovered, or found on the web.

<summary>What are some things I can find here?</summary>

Most of this is red team/pen testing articles, websites, and links. There will also be articles on computer architecture and design, malware analysis, and CVE exploration. I will also link to popular articles and notes of mine as well.
